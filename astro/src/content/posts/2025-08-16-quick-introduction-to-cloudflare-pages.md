After trying GitHub Pages as the most “barebones” static host, the next logical stop was **Cloudflare Pages**.  
And the jump in flexibility is hard to miss.

## Why not just stay on GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is great as a free showcase, but it has strict limits:

- Only serves static files.  
- No redirects or rewrites.  
- No server logic, no APIs.  

Perfect for a quick demo, but restrictive for real projects.

## What Cloudflare Pages adds

Cloudflare Pages feels like Pages **plus superpowers**:

- Automatic HTTPS and a global CDN by default.  
- Custom redirects and rewrites (so `/about` won’t break).  
- Integration with **Cloudflare Workers**, which means you can add APIs or SSR if you need them.  
- Deploys are extremely fast — usually seconds after a push.

In short, you’re still writing the same static site, but the platform itself is much more capable.

## First impressions

For small portfolios or demos, GitHub Pages is fine.  
But once you need custom routes, edge functions, or just faster delivery, Cloudflare Pages is the clear upgrade.  

It feels closer to Netlify or Vercel — but with the added benefit of being built on Cloudflare’s massive edge network.
