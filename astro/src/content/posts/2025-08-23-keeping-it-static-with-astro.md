Astro gives you the option to go hybrid: static, SSR, or a mix of both.  
But often, the simplest approach is still the best — keeping everything static.

## Why static?

- **Speed**: HTML is served directly from the CDN. No server logic, no cold starts.  
- **Portability**: works on GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, Vercel — basically anywhere.  
- **Stability**: fewer moving parts means fewer bugs.  

For personal blogs, portfolios, and small projects, static is more than enough.

## The trade-offs

Static isn’t magic. It has limits:

- No per-user personalization.  
- No real-time data unless you add some client-side JavaScript.  
- Content updates require a rebuild.  

But for content-focused sites, these are usually acceptable trade-offs.

## My choice

For this blog, I stick with static.  
I get fast builds, zero backend maintenance, and cheap (or free) hosting.  

If one day I need something dynamic, Astro gives me the option — but starting simple feels right.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: These notes are based on my experience deploying Astro sites on static hosts like GitHub Pages. If you’re coming from a traditional hosting environment (cPanel, PHP, WordPress), your path might look different.
