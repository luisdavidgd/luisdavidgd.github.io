When you put modern frameworks on GitHub Pages, you quickly realize the difference between **static hosting** and **server rendering**.

## React and Vue on Pages

*(Explain the need for hash routing or redirects, why `/about` breaks, and how you fix it.)*

## Svelte on Pages

*(Describe how Svelte handles static builds differently, and why it can sometimes avoid the same pitfalls.)*

## What static hosting really means

*(Clarify the concept: GitHub Pages only serves files, so anything dynamic must be handled client-side.)*

## Closing thoughts

- Static hosting is simple but restrictive.  
- Frameworks designed for SPA (single-page apps) need extra tricks.  
- Astro and Svelte feel closer to “native” static.
