Over the past posts, I’ve written about moving from cPanel to Astro, static hosting, routing quirks in React and Vue, Cloudflare Pages, APIs with Workers, and even using Supabase.  
Each one covered a piece of the puzzle.

This blog itself is part of my portfolio. I chose **Astro** not just for its speed and static-first approach, but because it lets me bring all those technologies together in one place:

- **Astro** for my personal site and blog.  
- **Cloudflare Pages** for fast, global hosting.  
- **Workers + Hono** for building APIs at the edge.  
- **Supabase** as the data layer and authentication.  
- **Svelte** (instead of Astro) for larger, dynamic projects like [chacla.pe](https://chacla.pe).  

## Why close here?

This series wasn’t just about tools. It was about building a stack I can rely on—lightweight, scalable, and flexible enough for both personal and community projects.  
If you’ve read along, you’ve basically walked through the architecture that powers my work.

## What’s next

The blog doesn’t end here; I’ll keep writing when I learn or build something new.  
But with these posts, I’ve drawn the outline of my portfolio stack.  

If you want to see it in action, you’re already here: this site is the [portfolio](/portfolio).
