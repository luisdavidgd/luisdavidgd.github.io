After moving from GitHub Pages to Cloudflare Pages, I also tried **Netlify** and **Vercel** to see how they compare.  
All three are great platforms, but they have slightly different strengths.

## Quick comparison

| Feature            | Cloudflare Pages                   | Netlify                         | Vercel                       |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **CDN**            | Global edge network (very fast)    | Global CDN                      | Global CDN (optimized for Next.js) |
| **Builds**         | Fast, integrates with GitHub/GitLab | Smooth CI/CD, automatic deploys | Very smooth, Git integration |
| **Functions**      | Workers (edge functions)           | Netlify Functions (lambda-like) | Serverless + Edge Functions  |
| **Framework focus**| Framework-agnostic, good SSG/SSR   | Framework-agnostic              | Best with Next.js            |
| **Free plan**      | Generous, includes Workers limits  | Generous, but build minutes cap | Good, but limits on team features |

## My takeaways

- **Cloudflare Pages** feels natural if you’re already using Cloudflare DNS. The edge integration is powerful, and deploys are fast.  
- **Netlify** is very beginner-friendly. The UI is clean, and it’s hard to break things.  
- **Vercel** shines with Next.js projects. If that’s your main stack, it’s hard to beat.  

## Conclusion

All three solve the same problem — **easy, modern deployments**.  
Which one to use often depends on your stack and comfort.  

For my case, Cloudflare Pages felt like the right upgrade from GitHub Pages, especially since I was already using their platform for other projects.
