GitHub Pages is a very basic hosting service: no server-side rendering, no edge functions, no CDN tricks.  
But that makes it the perfect lab to test how far Astro’s **static-first philosophy** can go.

## Why GitHub Pages?

*(Explain why you chose it: free, simple, accessible, but with strong limitations.)*

## The deployment process

*(Steps, pitfalls, maybe include your Astro config + GitHub Actions.)*

## Measuring performance

*(Share Lighthouse scores, Core Web Vitals, or subjective “feels fast” experience.)*

## Results and takeaways

- Astro remains fast even on barebones hosting.  
- GitHub Pages is viable for small portfolios.  
- Performance is not just about the platform — it’s built into the framework.
