For years, my websites lived inside cPanel — a world of FTP uploads, fragile PHP pages, and endless server limits.  
I wanted something lighter, faster, and easier to maintain. That’s how I stumbled upon **Astro**.

## The cPanel days

*(Describe the struggles: FTP pain, PHP spaghetti, performance bottlenecks, maintenance headaches.)*

## Discovering Astro

*(Talk about what you were looking for, how you found Astro, and why it stood out among other frameworks.)*

## Migrating a simple site

*(Show your first steps, a small Astro project, code snippets if you like.)*

## Lessons learned

- Static-first beats static-only.  
- Developer experience matters.  
- Performance is a feature you can feel.
